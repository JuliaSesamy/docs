It is possible to listen to locked podcasts in an standard podcast app, such as Apple or Google Podcasts.

The user can either open the locked podcast in a podcast app using the Sesamy Account page or using the web components on the publisher website.

If the publisher uses the Sesamy authentication the subscription dialog can displayed using the [Sesamy Entitlements Web Component](/docs/products/web-components/library/sesamy-entitlements.md)

If the publisher uses custom authentication it is possible to generate the private feeds on the server and rendering a [Sesamy Rss Subscription Component](/docs/products/web-components/library/sesamy-rss-subscribe.md)
