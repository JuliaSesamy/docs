If there is any locked content in Spotify that the user doesn't have access to they show a padlock in the Spotify app. When a user clicks the padlock they will be sent to the Spotify link flow for Sesamy. The user link their account using a code flow and the users access is verfied with Sesamy and optionally the publishers API.
