# Spotify Integration

Sesamy supports Spotify integration for podcasts. This means that you can offer Spotify Premium users the option to listen to your Premium podcast in the Spotify app. This is a great way to increase your reach and to offer your listeners a seamless experience.

## How it works

When a user unlocks a premium podcast in the Spotify app, the user will be redirected to the Sesamy login page. After logging in Sesamy will validate if the user has a valid subscription and if so, the user will be redirected back to the Spotify app. The user will then be able to listen to the premium podcast in the Spotify app.

If the user does not have a valid subscription, the user will be redirected to a checkout page or to the publihser's website.
