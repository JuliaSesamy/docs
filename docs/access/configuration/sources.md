# Sources

Sesamy Access can pull content from multiple sources when creating a new feed. Each source can be configured to either public or private.

If the titles or guid's matches between an episode in a public and a private feed,the private episode will replace the public episode for paying customers. This way it's possible to have dynamic ads in the public feed but keep the private feed ad free.
